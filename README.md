### Product Management System

### Description:

An advanced product management system can be developed using Spring Boot, featuring profiles, external configurations, and actuators for enhanced functionality. Manage requests efficiently through the Dispatcher Servlet, employing interceptors for authentication and logging, and leveraging Spring JPA for data management with service and repository beans. Use JPQL for sorting and querying, and implement binary trees to optimize product categorization and retrieval processes.
